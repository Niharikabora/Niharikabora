# Hello, geeks! 👋

_Niharika Bora_ here. I have a solid background in media and communications and a Bachelor of Technology with a computer science and engineering concentration. In college, I am heavily involved in *organisational works* connected to clubs, hackathons, fests, and seminars. I have also assisted in creating a number of communities from nothing.




### ⚡ One line that describes me best? 
 A girl attempting to make sense of things who loves to cook fries, day dream at nights and sometime codes too.😉😉
